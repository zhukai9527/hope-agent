# Docker Deployment

> [简体中文](docker.md) · English

Hope Agent ships official multi-arch container images covering `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, built and pushed automatically to GitHub Container Registry on every release tag.

What's containerized is the `hope-agent server` mode — an HTTP/WebSocket server that embeds the full Web GUI. Visit the exposed port in a browser and you get the same interface as the desktop app: onboarding wizard, Provider / MCP / IM Channel configuration, full chat. The Tauri desktop GUI and the ACP stdio mode are not container-suitable.

## Images

```
ghcr.io/shiwenwen/hope-agent:latest
ghcr.io/shiwenwen/hope-agent:v0.2.1
ghcr.io/shiwenwen/hope-agent:0.2
```

Pre-release tags (anything with `-rc` / `-beta` suffix) only publish the immutable `vX.Y.Z-rcN` tag. They never overwrite `latest` or the `X.Y` floating tag.

## Quick start

The simplest way to get going:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name hope-agent \
  -p 127.0.0.1:8420:8420 \
  -v hope-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/shiwenwen/hope-agent:latest
```

Once the container is up, open <http://127.0.0.1:8420> in a browser and follow the onboarding wizard to configure provider API keys and memory settings. All state lives in the named volume `hope-data`, which mounts to `/data` (`HA_DATA_DIR`) inside the container.

### With docker compose

A reference [`docker-compose.yml`](../../docker-compose.yml) lives at the repo root:

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose exec hope-agent hope-agent server token show
docker compose logs -f hope-agent
```

## Configuration

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `HA_BIND` | `0.0.0.0:8420` | Server listen address. Must be `0.0.0.0` inside a container — loopback rejects external connections. Translated to `--bind` by the entrypoint |
| `HA_API_KEY` | _unset_ | Optional externally managed Owner Root Token. Rust consumes and removes it before runtime initialization; it is never copied to argv or tool subprocesses. Browsers exchange it for an HttpOnly session and do not retain the root token |
| `HA_API_KEY_FILE` | _unset_ | Mounted secret-file path, preferred over `HA_API_KEY` for production. A trailing newline is ignored |
| `HA_KNOWLEDGE_AGENT_READ_TOKEN` | _unset_ | Knowledge Agent read-only token. It can only access `/api/knowledge/agent/{search,read,expand,sources}`, not owner admin APIs or `compile/propose`; useful for external-agent HTTP scripts |
| `HA_CORS_ORIGINS` | _unset_ | Additional allowed Web GUI origins, comma-separated (for example `https://ui.example`). Set only when the UI and API are deployed cross-origin; same-origin UI and packaged desktop webviews need no configuration. `*` is not supported |
| `HA_DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Data root. All persistent state (`config.json` / `sessions.db` / `memory.db` / credentials / projects / attachments) lives here |
| `HA_DEPLOYMENT` | `docker` | Hint to the self-updater. **Do not change** — without it `app_update install` would attempt an in-container binary swap |
| `TZ` | `UTC` | Timezone. Affects cron scheduling and timestamp formatting |

### Ports and networking

The image `EXPOSE`s `8420`. Without an supplied token, Docker generates one on first boot and stores it at `/data/credentials/server-auth.json` with mode 0600. Retrieve it with `docker compose exec hope-agent hope-agent server token show`. Compose still binds the host loopback address by default.

#### LAN / public exposure

For LAN or public access, keep the generated token (or configure `HA_API_KEY_FILE`), change the mapping to `8420:8420`, and terminate TLS at a reverse proxy. A non-loopback server without a token now refuses to start instead of silently downgrading.

Three typical patterns:

1. **Browser access**: the first visit shows the Auth Gate. The Root Token is exchanged for a signed `HttpOnly + SameSite=Strict` cookie and never enters URLs, localStorage, or the Referer. HTTP, media, and WebSocket requests reuse that short-lived session.
2. **Automation clients**: continue to send `Authorization: Bearer <root-token>`. Generic `?token=` authentication is rejected.
3. **Reverse proxy / VPN**: use HTTPS for public exposure. A VPN narrows network reach but does not replace the built-in token; OIDC or mTLS at the proxy is an additional layer.

Rotate online in Settings → Server to invalidate every prior browser session and Bearer client immediately. The CLI command `hope-agent server token rotate` stores a new token; restart the container or service to activate it. For `HA_API_KEY(_FILE)`, rotate the external secret at its source.

### Persistent data

The container's `/data` (`HA_DATA_DIR`) holds:

- `config.json` — global config (provider list, memory settings, temperature, failover policy)
- `user.json` — user preferences
- `sessions.db` / `memory.db` / `logs.db` / `cron.db` — SQLite databases
- `credentials/` — owner token, provider API keys, OAuth tokens, MCP credentials (**sensitive; files use mode 0600**)
- `agents/` — agent definitions
- `projects/` — project-scoped files
- `attachments/` — chat attachments
- `avatars/` — avatar images

**Always mount this as a persistent volume**, otherwise a container restart drops everything. `docker-compose.yml` uses a named volume `hope-data` by default. For a bind mount:

```yaml
volumes:
  - /srv/hope-agent:/data
```

The directory must be writable by UID 1000 (the in-container `hope` user).

## Docker isolated sandbox

Container deployments support only `isolated` sandbox mode. Hope Agent first creates a bounded temporary copy, then streams it through the Docker Archive API into an anonymous `/workspace` volume in the child container. The child container and anonymous volume are removed after the command, and changes are not written back to the real workspace. Because this path never treats the parent container's `/data` as a host bind-mount source, it works with named volumes, bind mounts, and NAS container managers.

`standard`, `workspace`, and `trusted` fail closed in container deployments. Those modes require a live bind mount, but a path such as `/data/project` belongs to the Hope Agent container namespace and cannot safely be interpreted as a host path by the Docker daemon.

To enable the isolated sandbox, explicitly mount a trusted local Docker socket and add the socket's group GID:

```bash
stat -c '%A %u:%g %n' /var/run/docker.sock
export DOCKER_GID="$(stat -c '%g' /var/run/docker.sock)"
```

```yaml
services:
  hope-agent:
    volumes:
      - hope-data:/data
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    group_add:
      - "${DOCKER_GID}"
```

If a NAS GUI cannot expand `${DOCKER_GID}`, run `stat` first and enter the numeric GID as an additional group. After recreating the container, sandbox status distinguishes a missing socket, insufficient permissions, an unreachable daemon, and a client configuration error.

> **Security warning**: the Docker socket controls the host Docker daemon and commonly provides host-level privilege. Enable it only for trusted single-tenant deployments. Do not make the socket `0666`, and do not run Hope Agent as root merely to access it. Isolated mode also requires a project or explicit working directory; execution is rejected when the working directory is the data root or one of its ancestors, preventing credentials, configuration, and databases from being copied into the sandbox (the official image uses `/data`).

## Browser automation

The image bundles Debian trixie's `chromium` package (adds ~250 MB to the image). The container sets `HA_DEPLOYMENT=docker`, so browser tool calls automatically start this Chromium in headless mode with the container-compatible sandbox flag — no extra configuration required.

### WSL Docker detection design

For Windows + WSL Docker Desktop, future Docker diagnostics should distinguish three execution surfaces: Windows host, WSL distro, and Linux container. Design constraints:

- Docker availability probes should record `docker context inspect` / `docker info` endpoint and OS metadata first; mark the environment as `wsl-docker` when seeing `npipe:////./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine`, the `desktop-linux` context, or a `/mnt/<drive>/` cwd.
- Path mapping must be explicit: Windows `C:\...` ↔ WSL `/mnt/c/...` ↔ container mount path are three separate layers. String replacement is not an authorization boundary; file authorization still uses Hope Agent's canonical workspace scope checks.
- Command execution semantics stay unchanged: explicit terminal / interactive shell commands still run in the user-selected visible environment; background Docker probes and non-interactive commands may use hidden windows and timeout protection.
- UI diagnostics should show only mapping summaries and repair hints (for example switching Docker context, choosing a WSL path, or binding a mount), and must not auto-migrate user project paths.

If your deployment doesn't need browser automation (e.g. a pure IM bot), fork the repo and remove `chromium` plus its runtime libs (`fonts-liberation` / `libnss3` / `libgbm1` / `libxss1`) from the [`Dockerfile`](../../Dockerfile)'s runtime stage to slim the image down.

Even without a `chromium` package, the agent can fall back to `profile.op=install_runtime`, which downloads a pinned Chromium snapshot to `~/.hope-agent/browser/runtime/` at first use.

## Ollama for local LLMs

The image does not bundle Ollama — Ollama has its own well-maintained multi-arch image, models are large, and GPU passthrough adds complexity. Keeping it as a separate sidecar gives users full control.

Enable the Ollama sidecar:

```bash
docker compose --profile with-ollama up -d
```

What the `ollama` service in `docker-compose.yml` does:

- Pulls `ollama/ollama:latest`
- Persists models in the named volume `ollama-models` (maps to `/root/.ollama` inside)
- By default only reachable from inside the compose network — Hope Agent talks to it over `http://ollama:11434/v1`
- GPU passthrough and host port exposure are commented out by default; uncomment as needed

Wire Hope Agent to Ollama:

1. In the browser, open Hope Agent's onboarding / settings panel
2. Add a new Provider, type **OpenAI Chat** (Ollama exposes an OpenAI-compatible API)
3. Set Base URL to `http://ollama:11434/v1`
4. API Key can be anything (Ollama doesn't validate it)
5. Model name should match a model you've pulled, e.g. `qwen2.5-coder:7b`

Pull models from inside the Ollama container:

```bash
docker compose exec ollama ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b
```

### NVIDIA GPU acceleration

Install [nvidia-container-toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html) on the host first, then uncomment the `deploy.resources.reservations.devices` block in `docker-compose.yml`. Verify:

```bash
docker compose --profile with-ollama up -d
docker compose exec ollama nvidia-smi
```

## Upgrades

The container upgrade path is different from the desktop bundle — the `app_update` tool detects `HA_DEPLOYMENT=docker` and routes the user to image pull instead of a binary swap:

```bash
# Using docker compose
docker compose pull hope-agent
docker compose up -d hope-agent

# Or using docker run
docker pull ghcr.io/shiwenwen/hope-agent:latest
docker rm -f hope-agent
docker run -d --name hope-agent ... ghcr.io/shiwenwen/hope-agent:latest
```

The data volume is preserved across image swaps; config, history, and credentials survive.

For production, pin to a concrete tag like `ghcr.io/shiwenwen/hope-agent:v0.2.1` rather than relying on `latest`.

## Reverse proxy

For production deployments, put Nginx / Caddy / Traefik in front for TLS termination. Hope Agent serves both HTTP and WebSocket (`/api/ws/...`), so the proxy must handle WS upgrade correctly.

Caddy example:

```caddyfile
hope.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8420
}
```

Caddy handles WebSocket upgrades automatically; no extra config needed.

Nginx example:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name hope.example.com;

    # TLS config omitted

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8420;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;
        proxy_send_timeout 86400s;
    }
}
```

## FAQ

**Port refuses connections after starting?** The server inside the container must bind `0.0.0.0`. The image sets `HA_BIND=0.0.0.0:8420` by default — do not override to `127.0.0.1:...`.

**Browser shows a "Front-end not built" placeholder page?** The image build failed silently. Check that `pnpm build` succeeded in the `web` stage (the Dockerfile has a `test -s dist/index.html` assertion that should catch this).

**History disappeared after upgrade?** The data volume wasn't mounted. When recreating the container, make sure `/data` points at the same volume.

**Does it run on Apple Silicon / Raspberry Pi?** Yes. The `linux/arm64` image is built exactly for Apple Silicon, Raspberry Pi 4/5, and ARM cloud VMs; functionally identical to amd64.

**`docker exec hope-agent server status` reports "no server"?** The entrypoint clears `server.pid` on startup to avoid stale-PID misreporting. The server inside the container is the foreground PID 1 (tini → entrypoint → hope-agent); `server status` is designed for systemd / launchd-registered background services and doesn't apply here. Use `docker logs` or HEALTHCHECK instead.

**Forgot the Owner Token?** Run `docker compose exec hope-agent hope-agent server token show`. If an external secret owns the token, the command prints that effective value; never paste the output into logs or tickets.

## Forks and custom images

To run `.github/workflows/docker.yml` from a fork:

- In the fork's GitHub repo, go to Settings → Actions → General → Workflow permissions and enable `Read and write permissions` so `GITHUB_TOKEN` can push to GHCR
- The image name automatically becomes `ghcr.io/<your-username>/hope-agent` — the workflow uses `${{ github.repository_owner }}` dynamically

Or build locally:

```bash
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  -t hope-agent:dev \
  --load \
  .
```

`--load` combined with multi-platform requires Docker Engine 23+ and the containerd image store.
