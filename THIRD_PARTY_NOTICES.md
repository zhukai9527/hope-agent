## Vendored Skills (`skills/`)

The following skills under [`skills/`](./skills/) are adapted from upstream MIT-licensed projects. Adaptations include tool-name remapping (e.g. `read_file` → `read`, `delegate_task` → `subagent`), addition of `paths:` filter for context-aware activation, and minor stylistic edits.

## Bundled Icons (`vscode-icons`)

The colorful, format-specific file icons rendered by [`FileTypeIcon`](./src/components/icons/FileTypeIcon.tsx) (workspace panel, message attachments, project file browser) are from the **VSCode Icons** project, consumed via the `@iconify-json/vscode-icons` package and inlined at build time by `unplugin-icons` (only the icons actually imported are bundled).
