//! Cross-process Primary / Secondary election via an OS advisory lock
//! on `~/.hope-agent/runtime.lock`.
//!
//! ## Why
//!
//! `init_runtime()` and `start_background_tasks()` run startup cleanup
//! sweeps and several "global only-one" loops (cron scheduler, channel
//! auto-start, dreaming, retention timers, MCP watchdog, ACP backend
//! discovery, async-job replay). Before this module they assumed a
//! single live hope-agent process per data dir — desktop on its own.
//! Once `hope-agent server` and `hope-agent acp` started calling the
//! same paths (PR 6) that assumption broke: a second process's startup
//! sweep happily mark-errors the first process's running subagents,
//! deletes its incognito sessions, clears its cron `running_at` tokens,
//! flips its async-tool jobs to `Interrupted`. Two cron schedulers also
//! double-claim the same job; two channel auto-starts fight for the
//! same Telegram bot webhook.
//!
//! ## Contract
//!
//! - First process to acquire the lock is **Primary**. Tier is decided
//!   by `acquire_or_secondary()` exactly once per process; further
//!   callers see the same tier via `is_primary()`.
//! - Mode (desktop / server / acp) does not influence tier — first-come
//!   first-served. ACP-only deployments naturally become Primary.
//! - The OS releases the lock when the holding fd is closed, including
//!   on `exit`, panic, `SIGKILL`, and power loss. There is no heartbeat
//!   to tune; no time-based "is the previous owner really dead?" check.
//! - The lock file persists across reboots (deletion + recreation is a
//!   race on Unix because `flock` is inode-based). Only the diagnostic
//!   contents change.
//!
//! ## What "Primary" gates
//!
//! See `app_init.rs` — every callsite that mutates *shared* SQLite
//! state at startup or runs a "single owner" loop is wrapped in
//! `if runtime_lock::is_primary() { ... }`. Per-process state and
//! manual user actions stay tier-agnostic.
