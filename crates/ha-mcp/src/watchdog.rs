//! Background watchdog — health check + exponential-backoff reconnect.
//!
//! Design:
//! * One task per process, spawned from [`McpManager::init_global`] after
//!   the registry is built (and respawned idempotently if the manager is
//!   reused across subsystem reinit — in practice rare because the global
//!   OnceLock only fills once).
//! * Cheap health probe: checks `RunningService::is_closed()` on every
//!   `Ready` server. A broken stdio pipe or server crash flips this to
//!   `true`; we mark the server `Failed` and let the backoff kick in.
//! * No network `ping` — active probes would add steady traffic for very
//!   little benefit. We rely on `is_closed` + failures bubbling from real
//!   tool calls to catch regressions.
//! * Backoff: `min(backoff_initial * 2^n, backoff_max)` seconds, where
//!   `n = consecutive_failures.saturating_sub(1)`. Capped at 6 doublings
//!   to prevent u64 overflow for pathological configs.
//!
//! This module intentionally runs inside the shared `tokio` runtime — it
//! must NEVER block on sync primitives for more than a few micros. The
//! per-server `connect_now` call is awaited serially across servers to
//! avoid hammering the CPU during mass reconnect storms.
