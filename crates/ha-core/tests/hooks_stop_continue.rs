//! `Stop` block-to-continue, end to end on the live conversation path.
//!
//! The official Claude Code `Stop` protocol inverts `block`: the action being
//! vetoed IS stopping, so `exit 2` means "prevent stopping, run another turn"
//! and stderr is the feedback injected before it. `hooks::fire_stop` implements
//! that by re-driving the session through the subagent injection pipeline —
//! which makes it the only hook path that can *resurrect* a finished turn, and
//! therefore the one whose guards matter most:
//!
//! * a turn the USER interrupted must never be re-driven (`is_natural_stop`);
//! * a natural completion must be re-driven;
//! * the live continue counter must reach the payload as `stop_hook_active` so
//!   a script can break its own loop.
//!
//! The fixture (`stop_journal.sh`) blocks unconditionally AND appends its raw
//! stdin payload to a journal file, so each assertion reads the real serialized
//! `status` / `stop_hook_active` the engine sent rather than inferring them.
//!
//! COUPLING (read before changing either side, and do NOT delete this test if
//! it starts failing — the failure is the point):
//!  1. `subagent::injection::inject_and_run_parent` emits its
//!     `parent_agent_stream` `"started"` event (step 3) BEFORE it builds and
//!     checks the model chain (step 4). That is what makes the re-drive
//!     observable in a test environment with NO provider configured. If
//!     "started" ever moves below the empty-chain bail-out, section 2 inverts
//!     from "arrives" to "never arrives".
//!  2. `hooks::stop_continue_inject` DISCARDS the `InjectionOutcome` and returns
//!     `true` on any resolvable session/agent, so the continue counter is NOT
//!     rolled back when the injection can't actually run a turn. That is what
//!     makes section 3 observe `stop_hook_active: true`. If it starts honoring
//!     the outcome, section 3 inverts to `false`.
//!
//! Deliberately NOT covered here: the full 1..3-honored / 4th-suppressed
//! `MAX_STOP_CONTINUES` sequence. A suppressed 4th fire has no positive signal
//! (nothing is emitted) and the ordering of the spawned fire-and-forget tasks is
//! only loosely observable, so asserting it here would be flaky theatre. That
//! math is already covered deterministically by
//! `hooks::guard_tests::stop_continue_counter_caps_resets_and_never_leaks` in
//! `crates/ha-core/src/hooks/mod.rs`.
//!
//! Single `#[tokio::test]` per binary: `install_hook` writes process-global
//! config and `reload_from_config()` swaps a global registry, so two test fns in
//! one binary would race on parallel threads.
//!
//! Unix-only: the hook shells out to `bash`.
