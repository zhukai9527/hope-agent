# Official-style Claude Code PreCompact hook: observe an upcoming compaction.
#
# The official PreCompact payload carries the user's configured
# `custom_instructions` (the free-text guidance the summarizer should honor)
# alongside the `trigger` (`manual` / `auto` / `tool_loop`). Official scripts
# read both to decide whether to veto or annotate the compaction; an omitted or
# renamed `custom_instructions` would silently drop the user's guidance. Both
# keys are echoed back so the Rust side asserts they arrived verbatim.
