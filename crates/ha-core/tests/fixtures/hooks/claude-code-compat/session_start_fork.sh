# Official-style Claude Code SessionStart hook: seed context per start source.
#
# The official payload names the start cause `source` (`startup` / `resume` /
# `clear` / `compact` / `fork`) and, when one is already set, the current
# `session_title`. Official scripts branch on `.source` to decide what context
# to inject, and `fork` is the newest member of that set — a variant that failed
# to serialize as the lowercase official token would drop such a script into its
# default branch. Both keys are echoed back for assertion.

# a heredoc yields invalid JSON that the host silently treats as "the hook
# contributed nothing" — indistinguishable from a missing field.
