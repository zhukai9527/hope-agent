# Official-style Claude Code PermissionRequest / PermissionDenied hook: audit
# what the approval chain was asked to gate.
#
# The official approval payloads carry `tool_name` plus the full `tool_input`
# object — the same shape PreToolUse uses — so ONE official policy script can
# gate `.tool_input.command` across the pre-tool and approval events unchanged.
# Hope Agent additionally emits a flat `command` extension; this fixture reads
# only the official pair so a regression that kept `command` alive while
# dropping `tool_input` still fails. The event name is echoed to tell the two
# dispatches apart from one fixture.
