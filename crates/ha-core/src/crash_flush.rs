//! Crash-time hooks for flushing in-flight `StreamPersister` placeholders
//! when the process is exiting cleanly. Signal handlers run on actual
//! shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM/Ctrl+C/Ctrl+Break) and call
//! `flush_all_blocking` to mark every active placeholder `orphaned` before
//! `std::process::exit`.
//!
//! Panic recovery is intentionally NOT global. Tokio tasks, Tauri commands,
//! and `catch_unwind` boundaries routinely turn local panics into recovered
//! errors while the process keeps running; flushing every active persister
//! on a panic anywhere in the process would corrupt unrelated active
//! sessions. Per-task panic safety lives in `StreamPersister::Drop`: the
//! unwinding task drops its `Arc`, `Drop` finalizes that one placeholder
//! to `orphaned`, and other concurrent sessions are untouched.
//!
//! `install_signal_handlers` requires an ambient tokio runtime; call it
//! from the Tauri `setup` async block, the HTTP server `main`, or the ACP
//! entrypoint after their runtimes are up.
