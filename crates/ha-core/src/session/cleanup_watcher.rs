//! `session:deleted` / `session:purged` watcher — fans a session-lifecycle
//! event out to every in-memory subsystem holding a reference to the session,
//! so deleting/purging a session triggers coordinated cleanup instead of
//! leaking:
//!   - pending approvals → deny + broadcast resolved (A-9)
//!   - async jobs → cancel running/awaiting (A-8)
//!   - IM `TEXT_PENDING` → drop the session's stack (A-9)
//!   - live turn → cancel (A-9)
//!   - per-session allowlist rules → clear (A-9)
//!
//! Mirrors [`crate::channel::worker::eviction_watcher`]: one EventBus
//! subscriber, name-filtered, each fan-out step best-effort so a single failing
//! subsystem can't block the rest.
//!
//! Spawned from both `start_background_tasks` and
//! `start_minimal_background_tasks` tier-agnostic sections. It must NOT live
//! inside `spawn_channel_listeners` — server / ACP have no channel registry but
//! still delete sessions and need this cleanup.
