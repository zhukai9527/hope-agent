Use this whenever you need to clarify requirements, pick between approaches, or confirm a \
decision before continuing. Each question renders as an interactive UI in the desktop app, \
as native buttons in IM channels that support them (Telegram, Slack, Feishu, QQ, Discord, \
LINE, Google Chat), and as a text fallback (reply 1a/1b/2a) in the rest. \n\n\
Guidelines: 1–4 questions per call, 2–4 options per question. Prefer single-select. Mark your \
recommended choice as the first option with '(Recommended)' in the label. Use `preview` for \
mockups, code comparisons or diagram snippets. Set `default_values` + `timeout_secs` only when \
the answer can safely fall back; they take effect only if ask-user auto-timeout is enabled in \
settings. Do NOT use this tool to ask 'is my plan ready?' — in Plan Mode use `submit_plan` instead."

        name: TOOL_ENTER_PLAN_MODE.into(),
        description: "Enter Plan Mode to explore, gather context, and draft a written plan \
before doing the work. After entering, you can read files / search / ask the user clarifying \
questions, and you must call `submit_plan` with the finalized plan when ready.\n\n\
## When to Use\n\
Prefer entering plan mode for non-trivial tasks across all domains:\n\
- **Programming**: new features, multi-file refactors, architectural choices, performance work, \
anything touching 3+ files, or unclear requirements.\n\
- **Writing**: pieces longer than ~1000 words, multi-section docs, anything with structural \
decisions (outline, audience, tone).\n\
- **Research / investigation**: comparing 3+ sources or angles, building a structured argument.\n\
- **Information organization**: sorting/categorizing 50+ items, building a knowledge structure, \
designing a taxonomy.\n\
- **Decision support**: trade-offs across 3+ dimensions, multi-step decisions with downstream \
consequences.\n\
- **Whenever you would otherwise use ask_user_question to clarify the *approach*** (not just \
requirements) — plan mode lets you explore first and then present a vetted plan.\n\n\
## When NOT to Use\n\
- Single-step or trivial tasks (typo fixes, single-line changes, single function with clear \
requirements).\n\
- Pure Q&A or research lookups (use the Explore subagent or just answer directly).\n\
- The user gave very specific step-by-step instructions.\n\
- The work can be done in fewer than 3 steps.\n\n\
## Behavior\n\
Calling this tool surfaces a Yes/No prompt to the user. The user has the final say — if \
they accept, the session transitions to Planning state and the tool returns a success \
message; if they decline, the session stays in normal mode and the tool returns a \
message saying so. Only call this once per task; if the user declined, do not retry — \
proceed with the task directly."
