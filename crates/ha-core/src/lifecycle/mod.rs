//! Restart the running Hope Agent process across desktop / service / foreground
//! formfactors. Used by [`crate::tools::app_restart`] and the future
//! `/restart` slash command.
//!
//! Three routes, picked automatically:
//!
//! | mode                                          | route       | who actually relaunches              |
//! | --------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
//! | desktop (`is_desktop()`)                      | `Desktop`   | Tauri guardian (exit 42 + supervisor)|
//! | server **and** `is_service_installed()`       | `Service`   | launchd / systemd / Task Scheduler   |
//! | server, foreground (no system service)        | `Respawn`   | a freshly-spawned detached child     |
//! | acp                                           | n/a         | refused — IDE owns the stdio lifetime|
//!
//! [`restart`] is fire-and-forget — the OS-level handoff means the caller has
//! at most a few hundred ms before the current process disappears. Errors
//! returned by this function reflect "we couldn't even hand off" (no bridge
//! registered, no argv captured, spawn refused), not "the new process didn't
//! come up" — the latter is invisible from inside the dying process.
//!
//! The [`AppLifecycleBridge`] trait is the desktop hook (analogous to
//! [`crate::updater::UpdaterBridge`]): `src-tauri` installs an impl at
//! startup that calls `app.exit(42)`, which the guardian respawns.
