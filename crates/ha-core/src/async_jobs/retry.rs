//! R7.4 retry policy for backgrounded tool jobs.
//!
//! A backgrounded job that fails may be retried with exponential backoff — but
//! **conservatively, and OPT-IN by default** (`async_tools.retry_enabled`
//! defaults to `false`). Two safety rails:
//!
//! 1. **Eligibility is a CODE-LEVEL allowlist** ([`is_retry_eligible`]), not a
//!    user knob — only *idempotent, re-runnable* tools (`web_search` /
//!    `web_fetch`) qualify. `exec` is excluded (a shell command may have applied
//!    a partial side effect before failing — a blind re-run could repeat it);
//!    `image_generate` is excluded (re-running yields a *different*
//!    non-deterministic image, so a retry isn't "the same operation").
//! 2. **Default off.** Even an eligible tool re-RUNS on retry, and the eligible
//!    network tools are often backed by *paid* providers (e.g. `web_search` via
//!    Brave / Tavily / Google). The job layer can't reliably tell a transient
//!    failure (429 / 5xx — worth retrying) from a deterministic one (400 bad
//!    query — a wasted re-bill), so retry is opt-in to avoid surprise charges.
//!
//! Only `JobError::Failed` is ever retried (a clean dispatch error). Cancels,
//! policy denials, and timeouts never retry (see [`decide`]).
//!
//! This module is the pure decision layer: [`decide`] takes the tool name, the
//! attempt number, the terminal [`JobError`], and the resolved [`RetryConfig`],
//! and returns whether to retry (and the backoff). The worker loop in
//! [`super::spawn`] drives it. Keeping the policy pure makes it unit-testable
//! without a runtime.

/// state-safe; the user opts into the small re-bill). Only async-capable tools

/// - **Never** retry [`JobError::Cancelled`] (terminal user/session cancel),
///   [`JobError::DeniedByUser`] (deterministic — a re-run won't be approved), or
///   [`JobError::TimedOut`]. Timeout is deliberately excluded: the per-job
///   timeout cancels the *shared* job token (so the worker can't cleanly start a
