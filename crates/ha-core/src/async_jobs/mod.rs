//! Background jobs (R1 unified model): detach long-running work into background
//! jobs, return a synthetic `job_id` to the LLM immediately, and inject the real
//! result back into the parent session when ready.
//!
//! [`JobManager`] is the single production entry point (spawn / cancel / list /
//! inspect / replay / schedule). Today only [`JobKind::Tool`] is wired — the
//! `Subagent` (R6) and `Group` (R5) kinds extend `JobManager`, not parallel
//! APIs. The module keeps the historical `async_jobs/` name + log category per
//! the PRD's "evolve the lineage in place" contract; the persisted table / DB
//! file are `background_jobs`.
//!
//! See `docs/architecture/core/tool-system.md` and AGENTS.md for the higher-level
//! design. The user-facing entry points are:
//!
//! - `run_in_background: true` on any `BackgroundPolicy::GenericJob` tool
//! - Agent `capabilities.async_tool_policy = "always-background"`
//! - The auto-background budget (`config.async_tools.auto_background_secs`)
//!   for sync calls of async-capable tools
//!
//! The `job_status` meta tool is a snapshot/status escape hatch; completion
//! primarily flows through auto-injected `<task-notification>` messages.
