//! Cross-platform shims for OS-specific behavior.
//!
//! Entry points here are called from code that would otherwise carry
//! inline `#[cfg]` branches scattered across the codebase. Each entry
//! point has a single documented signature; platform-specific modules
//! (`unix.rs`, `windows.rs`) provide the concrete implementation for
//! their target.
//!
//! Guidelines:
//! - Prefer `#[cfg(unix)]` / `#[cfg(windows)]` over `target_os = "linux"`
//!   so macOS + Linux + BSDs share a path.
//! - Keep signatures the same across platforms so callers never need a
//!   `#[cfg]` branch themselves.
