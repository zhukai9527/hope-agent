//! Tool permission / approval system.
//!
//! Single-source-of-truth for "should this tool call be approved by the user?"
//!
//! ## Architecture
//!
//! The decision is driven by:
//! 1. **Plan Mode** (highest priority) — overrides everything
//! 2. **YOLO** (global / session) — bypasses all approvals (with audit warn)
//! 3. **Protected paths / dangerous commands** — force-ask in non-YOLO modes
//! 4. **AllowAlways accumulated rules** (project / session / agent_home / global)
//! 5. **Session mode preset** (Default / Smart)
//! 6. **Default fallback** — allow
//!
//! Public entry point: [`engine::resolve`].
