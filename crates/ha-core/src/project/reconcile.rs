//! Cross-database orphan reconciler for project-scoped memory rows.
//!
//! `delete_project_cascade` (see `project/files.rs`) modifies two databases
//! in sequence: `session.db` (project row + sessions) and `memory.db`
//! (project-scoped memories). Because they cannot share a transaction, a crash
//! between the two leaves orphan memory rows that are no longer reachable from
//! any live project. Symlink-style path escapes are already blocked by
//! [`super::files::purge_project_dir`], so the
//! remaining failure mode is purely "memory.db has rows with `scope_type =
//! 'project'` and a `scope_project_id` that the projects table no longer
//! knows about". This module sweeps those at startup.
//!
//! Runs once per process (out of `app_init::start_background_tasks`). Project
//! deletion is low-frequency, so a periodic timer would be wasted work.
//! Failures only `app_warn!` — we never want a stale memory row to block
//! application startup.
