// Keep the push connection alive while `.husky/pre-push` runs its multi-minute
// gates.
//
// `git push` opens the connection to the remote and negotiates refs BEFORE it
// invokes pre-push (that negotiation is where the hook's remote-SHA arguments
// come from) — verified with GIT_TRACE:
//
//   15:10:27.383  run_command: ssh git@github.com 'git-receive-pack ...'
//   15:10:32.180  run_command: .husky/pre-push ...     <- 4.8s later
//   15:10:32.536  run_command: git pack-objects ...    <- only after the hook
//
// Our hook runs fmt + clippy + typecheck + eslint + vitest + cargo test, i.e.
// 10-15 minutes, and the connection sits idle that whole time. GitHub's SSH
// server drops it ("Connection to ssh.github.com closed by remote host"), so
// the pack write right after the gates hits a dead socket: git dies of SIGPIPE
// (exit 141) *after* printing "all checks passed", and the push silently never
// happens. Measured: a 5-minute hook survives, a 15-minute one does not.
//
// `ServerAliveInterval` makes ssh send keepalives during that idle window,
// which keeps the connection open across the whole gate run (verified: same
// 15-minute hook, exit 0 with keepalive vs 141 without).
//
// Runs from package.json `prepare`, so a plain `pnpm install` sets it up.
